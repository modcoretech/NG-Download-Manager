# NG-Download-Manager

hey, so this is a little download manager thing i was messing with.  
it kinda works, kinda doesn't — depends on the mood i guess.

not really polished or anything, but feel free to poke around, break stuff, or make it better.  
there’s probably a readme somewhere… or not.

anyway, it’s here. do what you want with it.

peace,
